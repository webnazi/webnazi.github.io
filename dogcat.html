<div style="font-size:14px; text-align:center; font-family:courier,slab;"> 
So The page is just blank with two buttons leading to a random image of a dog or cat.



Local File Inclusion (LFI)
Having a look at the url I saw that the page was running on php and the pictures are stored in the 
dogs/ and cats/ folder, which passes the value "dog" or "cat" to the variable "view"
eg. /?view=dog and /?view=cat. So I try basic LFI (Local file inclusion) 
to attempt to view /etc/passwd 
eg. https://10.10.233.109/../../../../../../etc/passwd
But I fail due to it relating "Sorry only dogs or cats are allowed" 
So then I check for a string dog or cat in the provided value of "view". 
I try adding "dog" after a null byte %00 which passes the string check, 
but is not evaluated when showing the file. I then realize that I indeed did bypass 
the string check but it didnt open a file? 
After a bit of me fiddling around, I see that I am able to check the source of the index.php 
file using directory traversal. 
eg. https://10.10.233.109/?view=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dog/../index
So now I check if I cam able to read the /etc/passwd file by using 
the request https://10.10.233.109/?view=dog/../../../../etc/passwd&ext= 
And I am successful

Log Poisoning
So the log that logs all my requests, was found by me in /var/log/apache2/acess.log. 
So then I see that it saves my user agent header. So i saw if i could inject some 
sort of php code in the header so that it will get executed along with the main php file. 
So then i used burp, and managed to change header to "qwom is gay but bae" to test. 
Then i tested some php commands, but then it broke the machine and I couldnt see the log?? 
Then i tried cmd and got command execution. 
I get the reverse shell, and immediately found flag.php in the current folder. 
I cat the contents and found the first flag. 
After digging around a little more I found my second flag in the /var/www directory

Priviledge Escalation
After seeing that I can execute /usr/bin/env as sudo using sudo -l, 
I look for private escalation in "gtfobins." 
I find that simply "env /bin/sh" grants me the shell I escalated to root successfully, 
and began looking for the remaining flags. 
I find my 3rd flag in the /root directory. 
While looking around, I find a .dockerenv file in the root dir, which signals to us 
that I am inside a docker container. After fiddling for a bit more I find a folder 
in the /opt/backups dir. I find something that says 
"tar cf /root/container/backup/backup.tar /root/container.  
So i see that the script backs up the /root/container to the backup.tar file I found. 
Possibly running a cron job. I see that I have written permissions to the file and 
I try to write a rev shell into the backup.sh file. 
I open a listener on 8888 and get a shell back from the root. 
I can see that I am on the machine itself and not inside a container. 
Going into /root i find my 4th and final flag
